# JivaCalendar

JivaCalendar_Ecliptic.py is the backend file. It contains core calculations etc.

JivaCalendar_FrontEnd.py contains high level functions that you may want to use. Using the front end functions should be intuitive, 
and please let me know if it is not, so I can imporve it. We need to add functions to this file according to what Kamal Tyagi Maharaja says.

Note: The code is almost complete. 

To Do's for Utkarsh

1. Write documentation.
2. Replace solve_moon_time_Ec(lon,t) and find_new_moon_time_Ec(t) with solve_body_time_Ec(lon,t,body='moon_synodic') and solve_body_time_Ec(lon=0,t,body='moon_synodic'). Check extensively.

Cheers! Radhe!
