# JivaCalendar

JivaCalendar_Ecliptic.py is the backend file. It contains core calculations etc.

JivaCalendar_FrontEnd.py contains high level functions that you may want to use. Using the front end functions should be intuitive, 
and please let me know if it is not, so I can imporve it. We need to add functions to this file according to what Kamal Tyagi Maharaja says.

To Do's for Utkarsh

1. In backend make sure astropy_to_datetime and datetime_to_astropy are both correct for all timezones

2. In front end add option to give date as datetime and str, or maybe only datetime

3. Add a function in front end to change timezone.

Cheers! Radhe!
